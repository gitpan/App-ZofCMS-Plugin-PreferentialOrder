App-ZofCMS-Plugin-PreferentialOrder

The module is a plugin for App::ZofCMS that provides means to have a
sortable list of custom HTML snippets. The order can be defined by each
individual user to suit their needs. The order is defined using a form
provided by the plugin, the actual sorting is done by
MooTools (http://mootools.net) JS framework. Use of this framework is
not a necessity; it's up to you what you'll use as a front-end. An
example of MooTools front-end is provided in the documentation.

The plugin provides two modes: single sortable list, and double lists, where 
the second list represents "disabled" items, although that can well be used 
for having two lists with items being sorted between each of them (e.g. 
primary and secondary navigations).
